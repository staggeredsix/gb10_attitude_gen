                           License date: January 5, 2026


By using or distributing any portion or element of LTX-2, you agree
to be bound by this Agreement.

   1. Definitions.

      "Agreement" means the terms and conditions for the license, use,
      reproduction, and distribution of LTX-2 and the Complementary
      Materials, as specified in this document.

      "Control" means the direct or indirect ownership of more than
      fifty percent (50%) of the voting securities or other ownership
      interests, or the power to direct the management and policies of

      Agreement.

      "Derivatives of LTX-2" means all modifications to LTX-2, works
      based on LTX-2, or any other model which is created or initialized
      by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or
      output of LTX-2, to the other model, in order to cause the other
      model to perform similarly to LTX-2, including – but not limited
      to - distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate data
      representations or methods based on the generation of synthetic
      data by LTX-2 for training the other model. For clarity, Derivatives
      of LTX-2 include: (i) any fine-tuned or adapted weights, parameters,
      or checkpoints derived from LTX-2; (ii) derivative model architectures
      that incorporate or are based upon LTX-2's architecture; and
      (iii) any modified or extended versions of the Complementary
      Materials. All intellectual property rights in Derivatives of LTX-2
      shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement, and you may not
      claim exclusive ownership rights in any Derivatives of LTX-2 that
      would restrict the rights granted herein.

      "Entity" means any individual, corporation, partnership, limited
      liability company, or other legal entity. For purposes of this
      Agreement, an Entity shall be deemed to include, on an aggregative
      basis, all subsidiaries, affiliates, and other companies under
      common Control with such Entity. When determining whether an Entity
      meets any threshold under this Agreement (including revenue
      thresholds), all subsidiaries, affiliates, and companies under
      common Control shall be considered collectively.

      "Harm" includes but is not limited to physical, mental,
      psychological, financial and reputational damage, pain, or loss.

      "Licensor" or "Lightricks" means the owner that is granting the
      license under this Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement,
      the Licensor is Lightricks Ltd.

      "LTX-2" means the large language models, text/image/video/audio/3D
      generation models, and multimodal large language models and their
      software and algorithms, including trained model weights, parameters
      (including optimizer states), machine-learning model code,
      inference-enabling code, training-enabling code, fine-tuning
      enabling code, accompanying source code, scripts, documentation,
      tutorials, examples, and all other elements of the foregoing
      distributed and made publicly available by Lightricks (including,
      for example, at https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-2) for the LTX-2
      model released on January 5, 2026. This license is applicable to
      all LTX-2 versions released since January 5, 2026, and all future
      releases of LTX-2 under this license.

      "Output" means the results of operating LTX-2 as embodied in
      informational content resulting therefrom.

      "you" (or "your") means an individual or legal Entity licensing
      LTX-2 in accordance with this Agreement and/or making use of LTX-2
      for whichever purpose and in any field of use, including usage of
      LTX-2 in an end-use application - e.g. chatbot, translator, image
      generator.

   2. Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      Agreement, you are granted a non-exclusive, worldwide,
      non-transferable and royalty-free limited license under Licensor's
      intellectual property or other rights owned by Licensor embodied
      in LTX-2 to use, reproduce, prepare, distribute, publicly display,
      publicly perform, sublicense, copy, create derivative works of,
      and make modifications to LTX-2, for any purpose, subject to the
      restrictions set forth in Attachment A; provided however, that
      Entities with annual revenues of at least $10,000,000 (the
      "Commercial Entities") are required to obtain a paid commercial
      use license in order to use LTX-2 and Derivatives of LTX-2,
      subject to the terms and provisions of a different license (the
      "Commercial Use Agreement"), as will be provided by the Licensor.
      Commercial Entities interested in such a commercial license are
      required to contact Licensor. Any commercial use of LTX-2 or
      Derivatives of LTX-2 by the Commercial Entities not in accordance
      with this Agreement and/or the Commercial Use Agreement is strictly
      prohibited and shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.
      Such material breach will be subject, in addition to any license
      fees owed to Licensor for the period such Commercial Entity used
      LTX-2 (as will be determined by Licensor), to liquidated damages,
      which will be paid to Licensor immediately upon demand, in an
      amount equal to double the amount that would otherwise have been
      paid by you for the relevant period of time. Such amount reflects
      a reasonable estimation of the losses and administrative costs
      incurred due to such breach. You agree and understand that this
      remedy does not limit the Licensor's right to pursue other remedies
      available at law or equity.

   3. Distribution and Redistribution. You may host for third parties
      remote access purposes (e.g. software-as-a-service), reproduce
      and distribute copies of LTX-2 or Derivatives of LTX-2 thereof in
      any medium, with or without modifications, provided that you meet
      the following conditions:

      (a) Use-based restrictions as referenced in paragraph 4 and all
          provisions of Attachment A MUST be included as an enforceable

       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall Licensor be liable
       to you for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as
       a result of this Agreement or out of the use or inability to use
       LTX-2 (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses), even if Licensor has been
       advised of the possibility of such damages.

   11. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
       LTX-2 and Derivatives of LTX-2, you may, provided you do not
       violate the terms of this Agreement, choose to offer and charge

       liability obligations. However, in accepting such obligations,
       you may act only on your own behalf and on your sole
       responsibility, not on behalf of Licensor, and only if you agree
       to indemnify, defend, and hold Licensor harmless for any liability
       incurred by, or claims asserted against Licensor, by reason of
       your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   12. Governing Law. This Agreement and all relations, disputes, claims
       and other matters arising hereunder (including non-contractual
       disputes or claims) will be governed exclusively by, and construed

       To the extent permitted by law, choice of laws rules and the
       United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
       of Goods will not apply. For the purposes of adjudicating any
       action or proceeding to enforce the terms of this Agreement, you
       hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and
       venue in, the federal and state courts located in the County of
       New York within the State of New York. The prevailing party in
       any claim or dispute between the parties under this Agreement
       will be entitled to reimbursement of its reasonable attorneys'
       fees and costs. You hereby waive the right to a trial by jury,
       to participate in a class or representative action (including in
       arbitration), or to combine individual proceedings in court or
       in arbitration without the consent of all parties.

   13. Term and Termination. This Agreement is effective upon your
       acceptance and continues until terminated. Licensor may terminate
       this Agreement immediately upon written notice to you if you
       breach any provision of this Agreement, including but not limited
       to violations of the use restrictions in Attachment A or
       unauthorized commercial use. Upon termination: (a) all rights
       granted to you under this Agreement will immediately cease;
       (b) you must immediately cease all use of LTX-2 and Derivatives
       of LTX-2; (c) you must delete or destroy all copies of LTX-2
       and Derivatives of LTX-2 in your possession or control; and
       (d) you must notify any third parties to whom you distributed
       LTX-2 or Derivatives of LTX-2 of the termination. Sections 8-13,
       and Section 15 shall survive termination of this Agreement.
       Termination does not relieve you of any obligations incurred
       prior to termination, including payment obligations under
       Section 2. In addition, if You commence a lawsuit or other
       proceedings (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
       against Licensor or any person or entity alleging that LTX-2 or
       any Output, or any portion of any of the foregoing, infringe any
       intellectual property or other right owned or licensable by you,
       then all licenses granted to you under this Agreement shall
       terminate as of the date such lawsuit or other proceeding is filed.

   14. Disputes and Arbitration. All disputes arising in connection with
       this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration under the
       Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce
       ("ICC Rules"), by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with
       the ICC Rules. The seat of arbitration shall be New York, NY, USA,
       and the proceedings shall be conducted in English. The arbitrator
       shall be empowered to grant any relief that a court could grant.
       Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered by any court
       having jurisdiction thereof. Each party waives its right to a
       trial by jury and to participate in any class or representative
       action.

   15. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
       invalid, illegal
       or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall be unaffected
       thereby and remain valid as if such provision had not been set
       forth herein.
